Introduction\nFinancial  market  analysis  covers  a  wide  range  of  topics,  including  asset  pricing,\nmarket efficiency, and financial market anomalies. One important aspect of this field is risk\nmanagement, which focuses on addressing uncertainties arising from financial markets; one\naspect of that uncertainty is market sentiment impact (Shapiro et al. 2020).

Conclusions\nThis article presents two key contributions. Firstly, an improved language corpus was\nintroduced that includes financial phrases and terms to enable more accurate and in-depth\nanalysis of financial news articles. This improved corpus incorporates emotional mixing,\nresulting in 30 distinct emotions compared to the original five, which will improve data\nanalysis for researchers leveraging Text2Emotion to categorize articles based on emotional\nanalysis.
